_**Abstract**_ -- A method for repairing a memory device with faulty memory cells. The method includes defining a RA environment comprising a location of each of the faulty memory cells and a plurality of SR and a plurality of SC. The method further includes repairing the faulty memory cells based on an RA training process using the defined RA environment and mapping of the location of each faulty memory cell with the plurality of SC or SR. The method further includes training, based on a determination that indicates the at least one faulty memory cell among the faulty memory cells is left unrepaired and the at least one SC or SR is remaining, a first NN to perform an action for repairing of the faulty memory cells such that a maximum number of faulty memory cells are reparable and a minimum number of SC and SR are utilized during the repairing.
