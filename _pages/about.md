Hi! I am Helik Kanti Thacker. I am an Associate Staff Engineer at Samsung Semiconductor India R&D. I work on the Redundancy Analysis problem. I have completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. I used to seriously compete in programming contests, now I do it for fun and learning new algorithms and data structures. I also love travelling, and playing board and video games in my free time.
